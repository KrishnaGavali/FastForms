# FastForms 🚀

An AI-powered form builder that lets you create and edit Google Forms through natural conversation.

## 🎯 Overview

FastForms is a learning and portfolio project that demonstrates how AI can simplify form creation. Instead of manually building forms through Google Forms' interface, users can simply describe what they need and let AI handle the heavy lifting.

**Core Idea:** Chat → Google Form

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Form Builder**: Describe your form requirements and AI generates it for you
- **Edit via Chat**: Modify existing Google Forms by chatting with the AI
- **Google Forms Integration**: Seamlessly create and manage Google Forms
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive chat-based experience
- **Quick Prototyping**: Rapidly create forms for surveys, quizzes, and feedback collection
